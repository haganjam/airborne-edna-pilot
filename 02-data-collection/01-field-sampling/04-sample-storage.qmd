This document describes the conditions under which the samples were stored.

## Overview

Both the water and air samples collected in the field were preserved immediately in ATL buffer (Qiagen) and placed in a 4 C fridge as soon as possible upon return from the field. Typically, this would be 2-3 hours but was as much as 5 hours in some instances as the travel between some sites was relatively long.

The samples were then transported by plane to Belgium which means there was a period of around 6 hours that they were outside of the fridge before going back into the fridge. Upon arrival in Belgium, they were kept in a 4 C fridge until they arrived at the lab in Brussels where they were frozen.

We chose not to freeze them before arrival to avoid the inevitable freeze-thaw cycles during transport.
